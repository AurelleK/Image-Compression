# Image-Compression
Machine learning with Chebyshev transform for image compression
run the main program in your matlab version 2016
this program allow you to compress and decompress any color image with a compression ration more than 90 percent.
the compression program rely on 3 main steps
- transformation step performed by Chebyshev transform
- qantization step performed by vector quantization with kmeans and splitting method for learning
- entropy encoding performed by Huffman coding
